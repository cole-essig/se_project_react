WTWR (What to Wear?) Application
About the project
Full-stack application. Use the following frameworks:

React.js
Node.js + Express.js
MongoDB + Mongoose

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Its built in a way to feel personal with specific profile sections and to help with one of the simpliest yet most complex tasks of every day. Picking your clothes!

Using React this was built into logical and consise componants that break the project into reuseable chunks and correctly pass information up and down throughout the virtual Dom. It uses React Router to properly navigate pages and keep everything orginized.
